# Land cover API

A proof-of-concept micro API, implemented with Python, Flask, and the Google Earth Engine for easily retrieving land cover information with a 'cookie-cutter', i.e. a spatially explicit geometry.

The idea is to try a different approach towards making knowledge product that is powerful, useful but at the same time scalable, less need for maintenance and can be re-purposed, built-upon and further integrated into other products. More specifically, this would allow: 1) easy engineering of products 2) shifts towards a valued added model, compared to the traditional data reselling model.

## Quick start
