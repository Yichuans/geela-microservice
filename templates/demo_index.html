  <h1>Demos</h1>
  <p>A proof-of-concept micro API, implemented with Python, Flask, and the Google Earth Engine for easily retrieving land cover information with a 'cookie-cutter', i.e. a spatially explicit geometry.</p>
  <p>Our idea is to try a different approach towards making knowledge product that is powerful, useful but at the same time, scalable, less need for maintenance and can be re-purposed, built-upon and further integrated into other products. More specifically, this would allow:1) easy engineering of products 2) shifts towards a valued added model, compared to the traditional data reselling model.</p>

       <p>Ft. Protected Planet API. This demo shows land cover for each protected areas in the WDPA. The novelty here is that computation comes from the Google Earth Engine and that results are generated on-demand. In other words, there is no need to calculate statistics ahead of time - this is expensive and slow - and there is also no need to update statistics every time the underlying data changes. The decouping of data and methodology ensures either could be swapped flexibly and improved easily.</p>

      <p>The guess game is an attempt aimed at testing two things: first, gamification is an interesting way for mainstreaming, and second it can be a clever way to collect user generated data in order to train better models, which in turn results in better utility - all good for a positive self-reinforcing circle!</p>
